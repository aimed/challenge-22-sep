/*
Requirements:
- The check-in application lists seats in the plane that passengers can choose
- Different seats should have different fees (free, window, aisle, more leg-room, etc.
- A passenger can skip choosing a seat and check-in for free
- A passenger can pick a seat and check-in for a fixed price
- A passenger can only check-in to one seat (unless they cancel the check-in) The seat is reserved for 3 minutes for the passenger until they pay
- This is the minimum feature set. You can always add more features if you think they are relevant.
